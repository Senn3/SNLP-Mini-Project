Z gitarą wśród zwierząt - (Polish "Among the animals with a guitar") is a studio album of the punk rock band Big Cyc, released in 1996.
The title refers to a popular Polish TV educational show, Z kamerą wśród zwierząt (Polish "Among the animals with a camera"), led by Antoni and Hanna Gucwiński, the managers of the Wrocław zoo.
Guest starring:
Jarek Janiszewski – vocals on "Pasażer"
As always, Big Cyc dealt with current problems, like forced prostitution ("Wspaniałe miasto Amsterdam"), drunk drivers ("Alkoholu pełne nieba"), post-Communist leanings ("Gierek for ever"), or "Polish baseball without using balls" - baseball bats used as "problem-solvers". Hit single "Makumba", one of the group's greatest hits, was a story of an African student in Poland, who, despite being beaten by skinheads, makes a success and stays in Poland. The second single "Kręcimy pornola" is about home-made pornography thought as an easy way to make money by anybody who has a camera. Lyrics of "Pasażer" have little in common with the Iggy Pop original. The hero of the new version is a vandal passenger who demolishes the seats in a bus. The group is also making a laugh of the recent stars - Shazza and then-returning Krzysztof Krawczyk, who, as the song says, still sings and records albums, as opposed to Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix and other deceased stars. The chorus, sung in a characteristic Krawczyk manner, says: "They all bite the dust, only I will sing". There are also some nonsense lyrics in "Red Hot Chili Big Cyc".
