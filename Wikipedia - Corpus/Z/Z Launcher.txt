Z Launcher is an application launcher for Android, created by Nokia. The interface adapts to the user's habitations by predicting six apps or web links the user is most likely going to use, depending on time of day, and then displays them on the homescreen and changing them when necessary. It also allows the user to scribble a letter on the home screen to launch apps.
The launcher was first announced in June 2014, shortly after the sale of Nokia's mobile phone division to Microsoft. It has been on Google Play since then but as of 2017 is still officially in beta status.
In November 2014 Nokia announced the N1 tablet for the Chinese market, which comes with Z Launcher as default.
Z Launcher has been highly praised as one of Android's best launchers. A "Pocket Lint" review said it is "fun and different" compared to other launchers, whereas "BGR" called it "shockingly innovative".
