Z Battery RA was a Battery of 5th Regiment Royal Artillery in the Royal Artillery. It currently serves in the Surveillance and Target Acquisition role and is equipped with various weapon platform locating equipment using radars and acoustic sound ranging assets.
Z Battery was originally raised in Poona, India on 1 April 1824 as 4th Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery, part of the Bombay Presidency Army of the Honourable East India Company.
As a result of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company on 1 November 1858 under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858. The Presidency armies transferred to the direct authority of the British Crown and its European units were transferred to the British Army. Henceforth artillery, the mutineers most effective arm, was to be the sole preserve of the British Army (with the exception of certain Mountain Artillery batteries). On 19 February 1862, the Bombay Horse Artillery transferred to the Royal Horse Artillery as its 4th Brigade and 4th Troop became D Battery, 4th Horse Brigade, RA.
A reorganization of the horse artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 1st Brigade split as A and B Brigades, 2nd Brigade became C Brigade, 3rd Brigade became D Brigade, 4th Brigade became E Brigade, and 5th Brigade became F Brigade. As battery designations were tied to the brigade the battery was assigned to, the battery was now designated D Battery, E Brigade, the first of a bewildering series of redesignations. From 1866, the term "Royal Horse Artillery" appeared in Army List hence the battery was designated D Battery, E Brigade, RHA from about this time. Throughout this period, the battery was based at Ahmednager. On 1 February 1871 it was designated H Battery, C Brigade, became H Battery, D Brigade on 16 January 1873 and E Battery, E Brigade on 1 April 1875.
Another reorganization on 1 July 1877 saw E Brigade disbanded with its batteries distributed amongst A, B and C Brigades. The battery was now redesignated E Battery, C Brigade at Aldershot. By January 1882, the battery was at Kirkee. On 1 April 1882, C Brigade was in its turn disbanded with its batteries distributed amongst A and B Brigades. The battery was now redesignated N Battery, A Brigade at Canterbury. The battery took partas N/A Battery in the Anglo-Egyptian War, notably the Battle of Tel el-Kebir in September 1882.
The battery was disbanded in February 1884. The brigade system was abolished on 1 July 1889. From now on, RHA batteries would be designated in a single sequence.
Z Battery, RHA was reformed on 13 February 1900. The Brigade system was revived on 1 March 1901 and the battery was assigned to the 4th Brigade-Division, RHA on formation (along with AA Battery, RHA). In 1903, the brigade was redesignated IV Brigade, RHA and was stationed at Newbridge in Ireland. On 1 October 1906, the brigade was redesignated XIV Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery and was broken up on 1 August 1913. The battery was transferred to II Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery at Canterbury and was disbanded again on 24 December 1913.
As a result of the Action at NÃ©ry on 1 September 1914, L Battery, RHA was almost destroyed as an operational unit: of five Officers, three were killed and two wounded; of 200 Other Ranks, 20 were killed and 29 wounded; and five of six 13 pounders were lost. It had to be withdrawn to England to reform. 
(Tempy) Z Battery, RHA was formed on 1 September from the Centre and Left Sections of I Battery, RHA to replace L Battery in VII Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery, 1st Cavalry Division. On 3 September, the Left Section of I Battery was replaced by a Section of D Battery, RHA. On 15 September, this section returned to D Battery and on 17 September a section of J Battery, RHA joined. On 27 September, the sections of I and J returned to their batteries and (Tempy) Z Battery ceased to exist. The next day, H Battery, RHA joined 1st Cavalry Division in its place.
During the battery's brief existence, 1st Cavalry Division saw action in the First Battle of the Marne and the First Battle of the Aisne.
Z Battery, RHA was reformed on 9 October 1914 equipped with six 13 pounders. It joined the Ipswich based G Battery and O Battery in V Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery. V Brigade, RHA was assigned to 8th Division on formation in October 1914. With 8th Division, it crossed to France on 4 and 5 November 1914 and served with the division on the Western Front until January 1917. While with the division, it served in the battles of Neuve Chapelle, Aubers Ridge, and of the Somme. On 8 June 1915, the battery was re-armed with six 18 pounders.
On 13 January 1917, V Brigade, RHA left 8th Division and became V Army Brigade, RHA. At the Armistice, it was serving as Army Troops with the Fourth Army.
By October 1919, the battery had joined the newly reformed VIII Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery. On 4 January 1920, the battery was absorbed into B Battery, RHA.
Z Battery deployed on Operation Herrick 13 and 18 in Afghanistan.
