Z Code (like Q Code and X Code) is a set of operating signals used in CW, TTY and RTTY radio communication. There are two sets of Z-codes: one originally developed by Cable & Wireless Ltd. (the Cable & Wireless Service Z-Code) for commercial communications in the early days of wire and radio communications and another independently developed by NATO forces later for military needs and use. The NATO Z Code is still in use today, and is published in the unclassified document ACP-131. There are other sets of codes internally used by Russia's military and other operating agencies. The old C&W Z Codes are not widely used today.
A lot of the old C&W codes are derived from mnemonics (ZAL = (a)lter wave(l)ength, ZAP = (a)ck (p)lease, ZSF = (s)end (f)aster, etc.
